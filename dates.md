## Arrangements

Labs will happen in groups, and they will happen in the EEE level 1 lab. The first four labs would include GTA/UTA support. After the mid-term oral, the rest of labs are reserved time for the group project.

Each team will need to lend 2 PYNQ board systems from the EEE Stores. Please only lend 2 boards per group, and identify that who has borrowed the boards on the team forming proposal page
